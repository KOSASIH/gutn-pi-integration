# GUTN-PI Integration Technical Guide

This guide provides an overview of the GUTN-PI Integration project, including its architecture, design, and implementation.

# Architecture

The GUTN-PI Integration project consists of several components, including:

1. Raspberry Pi: A small, low-power computer that serves as the central hub for the system.
2. Sensors: BME680 and SGP30 sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and air quality.
3. Python scripts: Code that runs on the Raspberry Pi to read data from the sensors, process and store the data, and provide a user interface.

# Design

The system is designed to be modular and extensible, with separate modules for hardware, software, data, and utilities.

# Hardware

The hardware module contains code for interfacing with the sensors. Each sensor has its own Python module, which provides a high-level interface for reading data from the sensor.

# Software

The software module contains the main integration code, which reads data from the sensors, processes and stores the data, and provides a user interface.

# Data

The data module is responsible for storing and processing the data. Currently, the system stores data in a SQLite database, but this can be easily extended to other databases or data storage systems.

# Utilities

The utilities module contains utility scripts and tools for managing the system, such as scripts for starting and stopping the system, and tools for visualizing and analyzing the data.

# Implementation

The system is implemented using Python 3.9 and several third-party libraries, including:

1. smbus2: For interfacing with the I2C bus on the Raspberry Pi.
2. numpy: For efficient array operations.
3. pandas: For data processing and analysis.
4. sqlite3: For storing data in a SQLite database.

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the system, run the following command:
```
1. python software/gutn_pi_integration.py
```
To stop the system, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window where the system is running.

# Conclusion

The GUTN-PI Integration project is a modular and extensible system for integrating sensors with a Raspberry Pi. By following the design and implementation guidelines outlined in this guide, you can easily extend and customize the system to meet your specific needs.
